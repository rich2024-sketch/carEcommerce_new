      Buying a used car can be a smart way to save money while getting a great vehicle.
      But it’s important to be informed so you don’t end up with unexpected problems.
      Here are 5 tips to help you make the best decision:
    </p>

    <div class="tip-section">
      <h2>1. Set a Budget</h2>
      <p>Know how much you’re willing to spend before you start shopping. Don’t forget to include costs for insurance, registration, and possible repairs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-section">
      <h2>2. Do a Background Check</h2>
      <p>Always ask for the vehicle history report. It shows if the car has been in accidents, how many owners it had, and whether it has a clean title.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-section">
      <h2>3. Inspect the Car</h2>
      <p>Check the car during daylight and look closely at the tires, paint, lights, and engine. If possible, bring a trusted mechanic along.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-section">
      <h2>4. Test Drive</h2>
      <p>Drive the car in different conditions—on highways, through traffic, and over bumps. Listen for strange sounds and see how it handles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-section">
      <h2>5. Negotiate and Close Safely</h2>
      <p>Don’t be afraid to negotiate. Always complete the sale with proper documentation and consider using a secure payment method.</p>
    </div>

    <p>With these tips in mind, you'll be better prepared to find a reliable used car that fits your needs and budget.</p>
